# APA Template
I've developed this Word template to make it easier to prepare journal articles
that require subission in Word format and APA style.
It's a work in progress and I may add additional styles and features over time.

* Heading 1
* Heading 2
* Body Text
* Insert Table/Figure Here
* Reference

As a general note, most journal submission systems are not compatable with
"docx", so it make sense to save the file as "doc" format.

# Analysis Notes
The analysis notes template is a word template that I use for running
preliminary analyses.

The main styles are

* Heading 1: For broad sections of analysis
* Heading 2: For questions and sections of analysis
* Body text: for commentary

# Response to reviewiers
`response-to-reviewers.dotx` is a template with styles that I use when
resubmitting a manuscript following a revise and resubmit decision.
The template has styles for organising reviewer comments, responses, and quoting
changes. See the document for comments on the styles that I use.


# Accepted version template
`accepted-version.dotx` is a template for converting submitted manuscripts into
a more reader-friendly style for sharing on institutional repositories.
